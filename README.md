This starter is designed for flexibility. Using it, you'll be able to manage your website content entirely in Strapi, and get a Next app automatically generated. Marketing teams will be able to create pages and design their layout without help from developers.

This starter features:

- Pages creation within Strapi, no code necessary
- Fully flexible page structure: design the pages you want using UI Sections
- 8 UI Sections out of the box: Hero, RichText, LargeVideo, Testimonials, Pricing, BottomActions, FeatureRows, FeatureColumns
- Easy to theme with Tailwind
- Static site generation with Next
- An integrated Preview Mode, to view your pages on a private URL before publishing them

## Getting started

The easiest way to try this starter is to run it locally on your computer.

First, you'll need to create your own copy of this starter. You can do so by clicking [the "Use this template" button](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-next-corporate/generate) on GitHub, and filling the [form](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

### Backend

Create a Strapi project named `backend` using the [corporate template](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-corporate):

```
# Using Yarn
yarn create strapi-app backend --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-corporate

# Or using NPM
npx create-strapi-app backend --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-corporate
```

The Strapi server will automatically start and import sample seed data.

### Frontend

Leave the Strapi backend running in the background. Open another terminal tab, and make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies and start the Next.js server:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```

The Next.js server will run here => [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Customize your corporate site

To edit this website, you'll need to run both the frontend and the backend in your development environment.

### Adding Sections

We have built sections for you, but you will likely want to add more to fit your needs. Follow these steps:

- Create a new component in Strapi in the "sections" category
- In the Content-Types Builder, open the Pages collection and check your new section on the `contentSections` field.
- Create a React component that takes a `data` prop in `/frontend/components/sections`
- To link your Strapi section to this React component, open `/frontend/components/sections.js`, and add an entry to the `sectionComponents` object.

### Custom theme

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. To modify your page's look, you can edit the theme in `/front/tailwind.config.js`. Read the [Tailwind docs](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to view all the changes you can make. For example, you can change the primary color like this:

```js
const { colors } = require(`tailwindcss/defaultTheme`);

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: colors.green,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Deploying to production

You will need to deploy the `frontend` and `backend` projects separately. Here are the docs to deploy each one:

* [Deploy Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/admin-panel/deploy.html#deployment)
* [Deploy Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)

Don't forget to set up your environment variables on your production apps.

Here are the required ones for the frontend:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL`: URL of your Strapi backend, without trailing slash
- `PREVIEW_SECRET`: a random string used to protect your preview pages

And for the backend:

- `FRONTEND_URL`: URL of your frontend, without trailing slash
- `FRONTEND_PREVIEW_SECRET`: token of Next.js preview mode defined on the frontend

Have fun using this starter!

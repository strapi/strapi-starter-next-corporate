This starter is designed for flexibility. Using it, you'll be able to manage your website content entirely in Strapi, and get a Next app automatically generated. Marketing teams will be able to create pages and design their layout without help from developers.

This starter features:

- Pages creation within Strapi, no code necessary
- Fully flexible page structure: design the pages you want using UI Sections
- 8 UI Sections out of the box: Hero, RichText, LargeVideo, Testimonials, Pricing, BottomActions, FeatureRows, FeatureColumns
- Easy to theme with Tailwind
- Static site generation with Next
- An integrated Preview Mode, to view your pages on a private URL before publishing them
- Content in multiple languages using i18n

This starter uses the [Strapi corporate template](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-corporate)

Check out all of our starters [here](https://strapi.io/starters)

## Getting started

Use our `create-strapi-starter` CLI to create your project.

```sh
# Using Yarn
yarn create strapi-starter my-site next-corporate

# Or using NPM
npx create-strapi-starter my-site next-corporate
```

The CLI will create a monorepo, install dependencies, and run your project automatically.

The Next frontend server will run here => [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The Strapi backend server will run here => [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

## Preview Mode

You can turn preview mode on with a URL like this:

`http://localhost:3000/api/preview?secret=<preview-secret>&slug=<slug>`

`<preview-secret>` is the secret token defined in your .env config,
`<slug>` is the slug you entered in Strapi for your page.

While preview mode is on you can access `draft` pages just like you would `published` pages.

For example [http://localhost:3000/secret](http://localhost:3000/secret) would be available in preview mode.

A banner will remain under the navigation to let you know preview mode is on and it will also allow you to turn it off.

## Customize your corporate site

To edit this website, you'll need to run both the frontend and the backend in your development environment.

### Adding Sections

We have built sections for you, but you will likely want to add more to fit your needs. Follow these steps:

- Create a new component in Strapi in the "sections" category
- In the Content-Types Builder, open the Pages collection and check your new section on the `contentSections` field.
- Create a React component that takes a `data` prop in `/frontend/components/sections`
- To link your Strapi section to this React component, open `/frontend/components/sections.js`, and add an entry to the `sectionComponents` object.

### Custom theme

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. To modify your page's look, you can edit the theme in `/front/tailwind.config.js`. Read the [Tailwind docs](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to view all the changes you can make. For example, you can change the primary color like this:

```js
const { colors } = require(`tailwindcss/defaultTheme`)

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: colors.green,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Deploying to production

You will need to deploy the `frontend` and `backend` projects separately. Here are the docs to deploy each one:

- [Deploy Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/admin-panel/deploy.html#deployment)
- [Deploy Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)

Don't forget to set up your environment variables on your production apps.

Here are the required ones for the frontend:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL`: URL of your Strapi backend, without trailing slash
- `PREVIEW_SECRET`: a random string used to protect your preview pages

And for the backend:

- `FRONTEND_URL`: URL of your frontend, without trailing slash
- `FRONTEND_PREVIEW_SECRET`: token of Next.js preview mode defined on the frontend

Have fun using this starter!
